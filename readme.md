This project is based on the requirements of the project 1 of www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript. It's a website with book ratings and revies. Users can signup/signin, search for books, rate and write review for each book and see the reviews from the others. Users have the choice to query for a book programmatically with requests to site’s API. Also, the site make requests to a third-party API (Goodreads, another book review website) and get ratings for the same books from a broader audience. The code is written using python, flask, sessions and postgresql.
